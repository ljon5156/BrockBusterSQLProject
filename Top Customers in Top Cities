Here is an SQL query to find the top 5 customers in the top 10 cities by total amount spent:

SELECT 	A.customer_id AS customer_ID,							
		A.first_name AS customer_first_name,						
		A.last_name AS customer_last_name,						
		D.country,						
		C.city,						
		SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount_paid						
FROM customer A								
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id								
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id								
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id								
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id								
WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Acua', 'Citrus Heights', 'Iwaki', 'Ambattur',								
			  'Shanwei', 'So Leopoldo', 'Teboksary', 'Tianjin', 'Cianjur')					
GROUP BY A.customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city								
ORDER BY SUM(E.amount) DESC								
LIMIT 5
