Here are two SQL queries to find descriptive statistics for the film table:

SELECT 	MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY title) AS modal_title,	
		MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY description) AS modal_description,
		MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY release_year) AS modal_release_year,
		MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY rating) AS modal_rating,
		MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY last_update) AS modal_last_update,
		MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY special_features) AS modal_special_features,
		MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY fulltext) AS modal_fulltext
FROM film		
		
SELECT 	MIN(language_id) AS min_language_id,	
		MAX(language_id) AS max_language_id,
		AVG(language_id) AS avg_language_id,
		COUNT(language_id) AS count_language_id,
		MIN(rental_duration) AS min_rental_duration,
		MAX(rental_duration) AS max_rental_duration,
		AVG(rental_duration) AS avg_rental_duration,
		COUNT(rental_duration) AS count_rental_duration,
		MIN(rental_rate) AS min_rental_rate,
		MAX(rental_rate) AS max_rental_rate,
		AVG(rental_rate) AS avg_rental_rate,
		COUNT(rental_rate) AS count_rental_rate,
		MIN(length) AS min_length,
		MAX(length) AS max_length,
		AVG(length) AS avg_length,
		COUNT(length) AS count_length,
		MIN(replacement_cost) AS min_replacement_cost,
		MAX(replacement_cost) AS max_replacement_cost,
		AVG(replacement_cost) AS avg_replacement_cost,
		COUNT(replacement_cost) AS count_replacement_cost,
		COUNT(*) AS count_rows
FROM film
