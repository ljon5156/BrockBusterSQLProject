Here is an SQL query to find each customer's lifetime value:

SELECT 	A.customer_id AS customer_ID,	
		A.first_name AS customer_first_name,
		A.last_name AS customer_last_name,
		D.country,
		SUM(E.amount) AS lifetime_value
FROM customer A		
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id		
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id		
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id		
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id		
GROUP BY A.customer_id, first_name, last_name, country		
ORDER BY SUM(E.amount) DESC
