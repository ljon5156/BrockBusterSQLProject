		AVG(rental_duration) AS avg_rental_duration,
		SUM(F.amount) AS total_revenue
FROM film A		
INNER JOIN film_category B ON A.film_id = B.film_id		
INNER JOIN category C ON B.category_id = C.category_id		
INNER JOIN inventory D ON A.film_id = D.film_id		
INNER JOIN rental E ON D.inventory_id = E.inventory_id		
INNER JOIN payment F ON E.rental_id = F.rental_id		
GROUP BY C.name		
ORDER BY SUM(F.amount) DESC
